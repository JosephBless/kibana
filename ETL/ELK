Version Compatibility with Elasticsearch
Ideally, you should be running Elasticsearch and Kibana with matching version numbers. If your Elasticsearch has an older version number or a newer major number than Kibana, then Kibana will fail to run. If Elasticsearch has a newer minor or patch number than Kibana, then the Kibana Server will log a warning.

Note: The version numbers below are only examples, meant to illustrate the relationships between different types of version numbers.

Situation	Example Kibana version	Example ES version	Outcome
